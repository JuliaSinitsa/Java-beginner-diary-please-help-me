# Java-beginner-diary-please-help-me
One day I remembered that I always liked to study. It happened that when I was very young, I got a specialty that I don’t like now. And I asked myself: who do I want to be? I had all sorts of easier options, but learning Java is what will really make me happy. I feel that way. Please help if you can 🙏
